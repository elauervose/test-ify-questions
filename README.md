# Test-ify Questions
This is the repo for contributing questions to the question pool for the testing app “Test-ify”. Questions are written in markdown so they are easy to read no matter what area of expertise you have.

If you don't find the folder you need, feel free to add on or throw it into the "unsorted questions" folder.

There is a testing app on the way ... be patient with us! :smile
